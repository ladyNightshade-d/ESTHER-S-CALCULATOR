    <h1>Welcome to Microsoft Security.</h1>
    <p>Microsoft is one of the world’s largest cybersecurity providers, protecting identities, devices, data, applications, and cloud services for individuals, businesses, and governments. Its security business earns many billions of dollars and uses artificial intelligence to analyze enormous volumes of threat data every day so it can detect and block attacks quickly at global scale. Key products include Microsoft Defender for threat and endpoint protection, Entra for identity and access management, and Purview for data security and compliance, all designed to work together as one integrated platform. These tools help organizations defend against malware, phishing, ransomware, and other cyberattacks by preventing, detecting, and automatically responding to suspicious activity. Microsoft follows a Zero Trust security model, which means it never automatically trusts any user or device and always verifies identity, access, and behavior before allowing actions. It also publishes detailed security reports and learning resources to help cybersecurity professionals understand new threats and strengthen their defenses worldwide. For small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft Defender for Business offers strong, AI-powered protection across Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices at a simpler, more accessible level. Overall, Microsoft positions itself as a global leader in AI-driven cybersecurity and digital defense, aiming to secure customers as they adopt cloud services and advanced AI technologies.</p>
